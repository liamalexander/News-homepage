## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make a responsive nav bar that animates into view.  I learned more about CSS Grid and combining it with Flexbox.  I felt more comfortable working with the layout on this project.  I also learned how to use html picture tag to change images depending on screen width (and quality, which I didn't include in this project but will use in a future project).

### Continued development

I would like to practice more with CSS grid and Flexbox.  I also want to use Sass in a future bigger project and I will start learning React.
